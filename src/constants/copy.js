  aboutText1: `I am a self-taught, highly passionate developer. In just over two years, I have been able to amass the sort of experience it takes my colleagues years to gather.  I am currently a core team member of G2i, a US based remote team of developers where we help businesses build Javascript applications (mostly using React, React Native and graqphQL) to power their solutions.`,
  aboutText2: `I am a full stack developer with strengths that lie more on the Front end where I’ve had production and unit testing experience with React, React-Native, Angular 1 & 2 and NodeJS. In addition, I am not just a ‘framework’ guy and I have a sound understanding of vanilla Javascript as well having understood early that it’s all about the Javascript - get that right and mastering frameworks comes naturally.`,
  aboutText3: `
    I learn fast, I work hard, I am always coding, (ask my girlfriend!) and I also have previous design experience. I am very proficient with Sketch, Photoshop and Illustrator and this gives me an edge over my colleagues because I can work very well on both ends of the stack to deliver not just great business logic on the back, but interfaces that users can fall in love with.
